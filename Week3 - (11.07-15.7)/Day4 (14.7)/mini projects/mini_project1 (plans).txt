define two types of boxes and two different containers

the left container will contain one type of box (as divs) each with their own unique colors. 
We will create an eventListener that listens for a 'click' on any of those boxes.
If they are clicked then they will change a variable (selectedColor) to the relevant colors

create a double for loop (rows +columns)that will create many many if the 2nd type of box. Append each one to the second container.
create an eventLIstener and add each of these small boxes to it. 
Upon recognizing a "mouse passing-over" any of these boxes an Event will be triggered that changes the background color of the box
to be whatever the current "setColor" is.
